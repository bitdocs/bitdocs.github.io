You must have one power bit for your circuit to function, as without one of these bits, power can not be delivered to the other bits. Power This bit is the most basic in this category, as it only requires one 9V battery. This will be the most common, as the small battery makes your circuits very portable. How to Use To use the power bit, you need two things, a 9V battery and a 9V battery clip connector . Instructions: Attach the clip connector to the battery. Plug the connector into the port on the bit. Attach any other module to it. Once your circuit is built, flip the black switch, which lets power out into the circuit. Other Info Leave the power switch off while building your circuit, as it can cause unforseen circumstances. USB Power This bit is very similar to the normal power bit, though instead of using a 9V battery and clip converter , it has a Micro-USB connection that is used to supply power. How to Use To use this module, you need a power source that has a USB output (computer, battery bank, etc.), and a Micro-USB cable. Instructions: Use a Micro-USB cable to plug the bit into a computer, battery bank, or other device capable of outputting power. Connect the bit to your circuit, which immediatley powers it on. Other Info There is no power switch on this bit, so keep it unplugged from the power source until you are ready to turn everything on. Old Android charging cables would work well to plug it in.","title":"Power"},{"location":"power/#power-modules","text":"These are bits that deliver power to all of the other bits in your circuit.
