These bits actually do the work, as with just input and logic bits, nothing will happen, so you need an output bit for your device to function. All of these bits also pass electricity along, so connecting another bit to the end of an output will continue your device. This means you can have as many buzzers , speakers , and other noise making bits as you want! (Though we advise against this.) This section is all about the bits that produce lights and sound Buzzer This bit creates a buzzing sound when recieving power. It's very simple as it can't be controlled too much and has a very simple use. Other Info You can use the dimmer or slide dimmer bits to control the volume of the buzz. Speaker The speaker bit, also known as the synth speaker, produces sound when given an input from a sound producing bit How to Use The speaker bit doesn't just produce sound when given power, it requires an input bit to know what sound to produce. Instructions: Connect a sound producing input bit to the power bit. (ex. oscillator , MP3 Player , keyboard ) Connect the speaker to the input bit. Tune the input bit and the speaker's volume as needed, then turn on the power and the synth speaker will start playing the tune. LED This bit will light up green when it recieves power. Like the buzzer , it also is very simple. Other Info You can use the dimmer or slide dimmer bits to control the intensity of the LED type bits. The light sensor bit can be activated by any bit that produces light, including all LED type bits. Long LED This bit is almost exactly the same as the normal LED bit, but has a few key differences. Those differences are: Outputs a bluish-white light instead of a bright green one. As seen in the picture above, the LED is extended from the main electronic by a wire. Bright LED The Bright LED is exactly the same as the normal LED bit, but is much brighter and is colored white instead of green. UV LED The UV LED is the same as the long LED bit, though it emits UV light instead of normal, visible light. IR LED The IR LED follows the same pattern as the UV LED and long LED bits, but emits infrared (IR) light instead of UV or visible light. Other Info Because it emits IR light, it can be used to activate the remote trigger bit. RGB LED The RGB LED uses three dials (slides on some models) to control three values (red, green, and blue), to reach the entire spectrum of visible color. How to Use As you can see in the picture, the RGB LED bit has three dials that can be turned with the purple littleBits screwdriver. Adjusting these dials will control the amount of red, green, and blue that the LED outputs. Some newer models, like the one pictured on the littleBits website have slides instead of screwdriver dials, which makes adjusting the values much easier. These newer models work no different than the original ones, and the way you control the values is the only thing that has changed.","title":"Lights and Sound"},{"location":"output-ls/#output-bits-lights-and-sound","text":"These are the bits that output something, whether it be a light, some type of signal, a sound, or something else.

All of these bits also pass electricity along, so connecting another bit to the end of an output will continue your device. This means you can have as many buzzers , speakers , and other noise making bits as you want! (Though we advise against this.) This section is all about the bits that have moving parts or display data. DC Motor The DC motor is a simple motor that can be controlled to run either clockwise, counter-clockwise, or vary in speed and direction by the amount of power given. How to Use The DC motor has three different settings, cw (clockwise), ccw (counter-clockwise), and var (variable). While the clockwise and counter-clockwise settings are self-explanitory, the variable setting can be a bit tricky. The variable setting is controlled via the amount of power going through. Try it out by using a dimmer or slide dimmer with this bit. The wheel included with some kits can be attached to the motor to create an electric-powered wheel. Vibration Motor The vibration motor is very simple, just like most other output bits. When power is recieved, the metal disc connected to the main bit via the wire will begin to vibrate. Fan When the fan bit recieves power, the fan connected to the bit will begin to spin. Servo The servo bit is similar to the DC motor bit, though is much more specialized and controllable. How to Use The servo bit has two different settings. the TURN mode adjusts the position of the servo based on the signal it's recieving. In simpler terms, when in TURN mode, the servo can be controlled via a dimmer , slide dimmer , or any other bit that controls the amount of power. The SWING setting will have the servo move back and forth on its own. The speed of the servo in this mode can be slowed by lowering the power with a dimmer . Number The number bit has two seven-segment number displays that display different numbers based on four different settings. How to Use This bit has four different settings for counting. Those settings are up, down, voltage, and value. Up and down are in the couny category, while voltage and value are in the read category. For the count category, both up and down count up and down respectively when they recieve a signal. This bit will NOT count up or down continuously if there is continuous power delivered, it will only occur when a new signal is recieved. For example, attaching a button before this bit will increase the count every time the button is pressed, because the bit is recieving a new signal. If this sounds confusing, play with it a little bit, and you'll get it eventually. For the read category, the bit will, no surprise, read the voltage and value of the current signal. If you attach this bit directly to the power on a read mode, it will read 5.0 on voltage mode, and 99 on value mode. You can use a dimmer to control the voltage and value. Both scale similarly to each other. The voltage ranges from 0 (no power) to 5.0 (full power), and the value ranges from 0 (no power) to 99 (full power). Bargraph The bargraph bit is similar to the number bit's voltage read mode, but displays the information in a different way. How to Use The bit only has one setting, and that is to read the voltage of the current signal. Since the normal power is 5V, if this bit is plugged directly into the power, it will read all the way up to five. However, using something like a dimmer to control power, you can lower the voltage of the current signal. At 1V, the bit will read to 1, at 2V, the bit will read to 2, and that continues up to five.","title":"Movement and Display"},{"location":"output-md/#output-bits-movement-and-display","text":"These are the bits that output something, whether it be a light, some type of signal, a sound, or something else.

You must have one power bit for your circuit to function, as without one of these bits, power can not be delivered to the other bits. Power This bit is the most basic in this category, as it only requires one 9V battery . This will be the most common, as the small battery makes your circuits very portable. How to Use To use the power bit, you need two things, a 9V battery and a 9V battery clip connector . Instructions: Attach the clip connector to the battery. Plug the connector into the port on the bit. Attach any other module to it. Once your circuit is built, flip the black switch, which lets power out into the circuit. Other Info Leave the power switch off while building your circuit, as it can cause unforseen circumstances. USB Power This bit is very similar to the normal power bit, though instead of using a 9V battery and clip converter , it has a Micro-USB connection that is used to supply power. How to Use To use this module, you need a power source that has a USB output (computer, battery bank, etc.), and a Micro-USB cable . Instructions: Use a Micro-USB cable to plug the bit into a computer, battery bank, or other device capable of outputting power. Connect the bit to your circuit, which immediatley powers it on.
