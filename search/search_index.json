This changes the output of output bits. This set of bits can really make your device unique, and helps to define the purpose of what you're building. Many of these bits may sound confusing at first, but if you try them out for a little bit, we're sure you'll get the hang of them. These bits go output a range of power based on how much of a certain thing they sense. Light Sensor This bit will gradually increase power as it is exposed to more and more light, or the reverse in dark mode. Its function is similar to the button , though it activates gradually with light rather than instantly with a press. How to Use While the button jumps instantly to 5V when pressed, the light sensor gradually works up to 5V as the light shined on it increases. The speed at which the light sensor gets to full power can be changed with the sensitivity slider. The light/dark mode switch will change in what ways the light sensor releases power. On light mode, the sensor will release power as light level goes up, but on dark mode, the sensor will release power as the light level goes down. NOTE: Some older models may use a screwdriver dial instead of a slide for sensitivity. This works the same, however, you'll need to use the purple screwdriver to change the sensitivity setting Motion Trigger The motion trigger bit works similarly to the button , though instead of sending a signal on a click, it sends a signal when it detects movement. Other Info The range of this bit is around 10ft x 10ft, and is very sensitive, so don't feel like it's not working if it's constantly sending an on signal while you're working on it. Pressure Sensor The pressure sensor works similarly to the light sensor , but sends power based on the pressure put on the black circle. Proximity Sensor This bit works similarly to the light sensor , but sends power based on how close an object is to the sensor. Remote Trigger The remote trigger bit will send a signal when it recieves an IR signal. Things that can trigger this include your TV remote or the IR LED . Sound Trigger The sound trigger will send an ON signal when the sound in the room reaches a certain threshold. This threshold can be changed with the sensitivity slider. Temperature Sensor The temperature sensor works similarly to the light sensor , but reads the temperature instead of light. The bit also outputs the temperature read as a value, so you can attach a number bit to read the value. The mode switch on the side is used to change the value sent into Celsius or Farenheit. Threshold The threshold bit doesn't let a signal pass unless it reaches a certain threshold. This is is best suited to be used with sensor bits that have a range of voltage they can produce.","title":"Sensors"},{"location":"input-se/#sensor-bits","text":"These are the bits that modify the signal passing through your circuit.

This changes the output of output bits. This set of bits can really make your device unique, and helps to define the purpose of what you're building. Many of these bits may sound confusing at first, but if you try them out for a little bit, we're sure you'll get the hang of them. This set of bits generates or modifies tunes or sound. Delay The delay bit repeats audio that is given to it depending on a certain time and feedback. How to Use This bit only works when given a sound with a bit like the oscillator or the keyboard This bit has two knobs, time and feedback. The time knob controls the amount of time each sound and each silence lasts for. The feedback knob controls how many times the sound will repeat. If the feedback is turned up to the max, the sound will repeat forever. Envelope This bit is used to change the character of a sound to fit a certain instrument. How to Use The two main settings, attack and decay, determine how long or short the sound sounds. The attack setting determines how long the sound takes to ramp up to max volume. Zero attack would mean that the sound is instantly at max volume. The decay setting determines how long the sound takes to go down to zero. A zero decay would mean the sound is instantly over after the sound stops coming. The third connection point at the top allows you to trigger the effect with another bit, like the keyboard . Keyboard This bit is similar to an electronic keyboard, as it allows you to play specific notes with keys. How to Use The keyboard is similar to the oscillator , in the way that it produces a tune. However, the keyboard has a similar layout to a piano, and plays specific notes rather than electronic tunes. Pressing a key will produce a tone, and that tone will come out depending on two key modes, hold and press. In press mode, the note will come out while a key is pressed, but not after. In hold mode, the last played note will continue to be played until the mode is changed or the power is cut. The octave slide on the left will change the octave, meaning that when the slide is down, the notes are lower, and when the slide is up, the notes are higher. You'll notice there are two output connections. The normal postitioned one will output the sound signal according to what you pressed, the top one will output a normal 5V power signal when a key is pressed. This power output will still adhere to the key mode the keyboard is on. Other Info This bit can be used in conjuction with the oscillator to change the tune, pitch, and waveform of the notes. Microphone The microphone bit recieves audio from a seperate device or through it's microphone, and sends either sound or a 5V signal out after it. How to Use The microphone bit has two ways of inputting sound. The first is to simply play sound into the microphone. The second way is to connect an external device to the bit with a 3.5mm audio cable, and play music or sound on that device. When the microphone recieves sound in any way, it will then transmit that sound to the next bit in the device. However, the bit can change its mode from sound to other. In other mode, instead of sending a sound, it will send a simple 5V signal when a sound is recieved. Mix The mix bit allows you to combine to sound inputs into one output. How to Use You can use something like an oscillator to generate the tune for the bit. The two dials on the large portion of the bit control the volume of each input. MP3 Player The MP3 player bit plays MP3 files off of a Micro-SD card inside the bit. How to Use To start, load all of your mp3 files onto a micro-sd card and add a number in the front according to the order you want tracks to be played (ex: \"bigman.mp3\" and \"smallboy.mp3\" turn into \"1bigman.mp3\" and \"2smallboy.mp3\"). The numbers do not have to be in the front without spaces, just the first thing in the file's name. The mode switch on the side determines how the tracks will be played. In once mode, it will play the current track once. In loop mode, it will continuously loop through the whole SD card. In next mode, it will just play the next track, and in all mode, it will play the whole card through once. You can connect the bit to a speaker to play the music, or output it with the 3.5mm output jack. Oscillator The oscillator bit can adjust or create a tone by changing its tune, pitch and waveform. How to Use The oscillator has three settings, tune, pitch, and waveform. The pitch dial is used to adjust the pitch of the bit. A higher value on the dial will mean a higher pitch. The waveform switch can switch between a square and sawtooth waveform, which both produce different sounds. You can attach the oscillator after a sound producing bit like the keyboard to modify its sound. In this case, the tune slide actually does something, as it will modify the tune of the recieved sound. The pitch and waveform dials work the same when modifying sound. Random The random bit can either send white noise or a random voltage each time a new signal is sent. How to Use The noise setting will just send white noise, while the random voltage will create a random voltage that can control the tune of an oscillator. You will need a pulse bit to keep generating new tunes, as the bit will only generate a new voltage on a new signal.","title":"Sound"},{"location":"input-so/#sound-based-input-bits","text":"These are the bits that modify the signal passing through your circuit.

Many of these bits may sound confusing at first, but if you try them out for a little bit, we're sure you'll get the hang of them. These bits switch other bits on and off. Button When the button is pressed, it sends an ON signal. When it is not pressed, it sends an OFF signal. Dimmer The dimmer bit limits the amount of power that goes through it, thus reducing the intensity of things like lights and buzzers . The more you turn the dimmer counter-clockwise, the less power there is, until there is no power going through at all. This can also be used to control the motion of the servo in TURN mode. Pulse The pulse bit sends power out at a consistent and specific rate that is determined by the slider on the bottom of the bit. Roller Switch The roller switch works like the button , as when you click the switch, power is let through. However, you can also invert this, by making the power turn off when the top-left switch is set to open. Sequencer The sequencer can activate up to 8 different outputs in a certain order. How to Use The sequencer bit has two settings. The dial in the middle determines how the sequence is progressed. Forward will go 1-8, backwards will go 8-1, pendulum will go 1-8, then 8-1, like a pendulum, and random will simply turn on a random output. The switch on the side determines how fast the sequence is progressed. In step mode, the next output is activated whenever a new pulse is recieved. You should use this setting with a pulse bit to control the speed of the sequence. When the setting is on speed, it will progress based on the voltage. The voltage can be controlled with a dimmer . Slide Dimmer The slide dimmer works like a normal dimmer , but uses a slide instead of a dial to adjust voltage. Slide Switch The slide switch lets power through when set to ON, but doesn't when set to OFF. Timeout The timeout bit sets a timer when it recieves an ON signal, and changes its output once the timer has run out. The screwdriver dial is used to adjust the length of the timer. The switch can change the mode from on-off (will send an ON signal until timer runs out) to off-on (will send an OFF singal until timer runs out), and vice versa. Toggle Switch The toggle switch works like the slide switch , but uses a lever instead of a slider.","title":"Switches"},{"location":"input-sw/#switch-input-bits","text":"These are the bits that modify the signal passing through your circuit.

All of these bits also pass electricity along, so connecting another bit to the end of an output will continue your device. This means you can have as many buzzers , speakers , and other noise making bits as you want! (Though we advise against this.) This section is all about the bits that produce lights and sound Buzzer This bit creates a buzzing sound when recieving power. It's very simple as it can't be controlled too much and has a very simple use. Other Info You can use the dimmer or slide dimmer bits to control the volume of the buzz. Speaker The speaker bit, also known as the synth speaker, produces sound when given an input from a sound producing bit How to Use The speaker bit doesn't just produce sound when given power, it requires an input bit to know what sound to produce. Instructions: Connect a sound producing input bit to the power bit. (ex. oscillator , MP3 Player , keyboard ) Connect the speaker to the input bit. Tune the input bit and the speaker's volume as needed, then turn on the power and the synth speaker will start playing the tune. LED This bit will light up green when it recieves power. Like the buzzer , it also is very simple. Other Info You can use the dimmer or slide dimmer bits to control the intensity of the LED type bits. The light sensor bit can be activated by any bit that produces light, including all LED type bits. Long LED This bit is almost exactly the same as the normal LED bit, but has a few key differences. Those differences are: Outputs a bluish-white light instead of a bright green one. As seen in the picture above, the LED is extended from the main electronic by a wire. Bright LED The Bright LED is exactly the same as the normal LED bit, but is much brighter and is colored white instead of green. UV LED The UV LED is the same as the long LED bit, though it emits UV light instead of normal, visible light. IR LED The IR LED follows the same pattern as the UV LED and long LED bits, but emits infrared (IR) light instead of UV or visible light. Other Info Because it emits IR light, it can be used to activate the remote trigger bit. RGB LED The RGB LED uses three dials (slides on some models) to control three values (red, green, and blue), to reach the entire spectrum of visible color. How to Use As you can see in the picture, the RGB LED bit has three dials that can be turned with the purple littleBits screwdriver. Adjusting these dials will control the amount of red, green, and blue that the LED outputs. Some newer models, like the one pictured on the littleBits website have slides instead of screwdriver dials, which makes adjusting the values much easier.

This section is all about the bits that have moving parts or display data. DC Motor The DC motor is a simple motor that can be controlled to run either clockwise, counter-clockwise, or vary in speed and direction by the amount of power given. How to Use The DC motor has three different settings, cw (clockwise), ccw (counter-clockwise), and var (variable). While the clockwise and counter-clockwise settings are self-explanitory, the variable setting can be a bit tricky. The variable setting is controlled via the amount of power going through. Try it out by using a dimmer or slide dimmer with this bit. The wheel included with some kits can be attached to the motor to create an electric-powered wheel. Vibration Motor The vibration motor is very simple, just like most other output bits. When power is recieved, the metal disc connected to the main bit via the wire will begin to vibrate. Fan When the fan bit recieves power, the fan connected to the bit will begin to spin. Servo The servo bit is similar to the DC motor bit, though is much more specialized and controllable. How to Use The servo bit has two different settings. the TURN mode adjusts the position of the servo based on the signal it's recieving. In simpler terms, when in TURN mode, the servo can be controlled via a dimmer , slide dimmer , or any other bit that controls the amount of power. The SWING setting will have the servo move back and forth on its own. The speed of the servo in this mode can be slowed by lowering the power with a dimmer . Number The number bit has two seven-segment number displays that display different numbers based on four different settings. How to Use This bit has four different settings for counting. Those settings are up, down, voltage, and value. Up and down are in the couny category, while voltage and value are in the read category. For the count category, both up and down count up and down respectively when they recieve a signal. This bit will NOT count up or down continuously if there is continuous power delivered, it will only occur when a new signal is recieved. For example, attaching a button before this bit will increase the count every time the button is pressed, because the bit is recieving a new signal. If this sounds confusing, play with it a little bit, and you'll get it eventually. For the read category, the bit will, no surprise, read the voltage and value of the current signal. If you attach this bit directly to the power on a read mode, it will read 5.0 on voltage mode, and 99 on value mode. You can use a dimmer to control the voltage and value. Both scale similarly to each other. The voltage ranges from 0 (no power) to 5.0 (full power), and the value ranges from 0 (no power) to 99 (full power). Bargraph The bargraph bit is similar to the number bit's voltage read mode, but displays the information in a different way. How to Use The bit only has one setting, and that is to read the voltage of the current signal. Since the normal power is 5V, if this bit is plugged directly into the power, it will read all the way up to five. However, using something like a dimmer to control power, you can lower the voltage of the current signal. At 1V, the bit will read to 1, at 2V, the bit will read to 2, and that continues up to five.","title":"Movement and Display"},{"location":"output-md/#output-bits-movement-and-display","text":"These are the bits that output something, whether it be a light, some type of signal, a sound, or something else.
